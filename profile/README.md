## Background the project

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the Philippines will be the country in Southeast Asia with the highest unemployment rate in 2023. Meanwhile, Indonesia will follow next. With a projected unemployment rate of 5.3%. According to a report from the Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), the Tingkat Pengangguran Terbuka (TPT) reached 5.86 percent as of August 2022. This percentage is the same as 8.42 million unemployed people in Indonesia. This makes job seekers in Indonesia need jobs. Many job positions are needed, one of which is in the world of entertainment. The entertainment industry in Indonesia has been growing in recent years, with more and more people showing interest. However, the lack of platforms for job seekers in the entertainment sector has made it difficult for job seekers to gain market share.

Therefore, our team wants to solve this problem by providing a centralized platform for freelancers in the field of entertainment that can be accessed anytime and anywhere. We believe that this app will not only help individuals find jobs, but also contribute to the growth of the entertainment industry in Indonesia. This app aims to create new income opportunities for individuals who have skills such as singers, magicians, comedians, models, presenters, and other talents. There are many other job portal platforms out there such as Fiverr that handle freelance work that can be done remotely and also cover a global market share. However, the main difference between our goal and Fiverr's lies in our app's system where freelance work is done directly on location, as well as a more focused and market-oriented approach to the Indonesian entertainment industry. Our app has the advantage of being designed with user needs in mind such as providing a feature for customers to pay freelancers directly through the app according to the agreement made, an attractive and easy-to-use UI/UX interface, in addition we also provide a security system to detect images containing nudity content based on deep learning to increase user convenience.
