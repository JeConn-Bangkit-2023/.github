## About the project

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the Philippines will be the country in Southeast Asia with the highest unemployment rate in 2023. Meanwhile, Indonesia will follow next. With a projected unemployment rate of 5.3%. According to a report from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the Open Unemployment Rate (TPT) reached 5.86 percent as of August 2022. This percentage is the same as 8.42 million unemployed people in Indonesia. This makes job seekers in Indonesia need jobs. Many job positions are needed, one of which is in the world of entertainment. The entertainment industry in Indonesia has been growing in recent years, with more and more people showing interest. However, the lack of platforms for job seekers in the entertainment sector has made it difficult for job seekers to gain market share.

Therefore, our team wants to solve this problem by providing a centralized platform that can be accessed by anyone, anytime and anywhere. Our application will be designed taking into account user needs such as providing features for customers to pay workers directly through the application according to the agreement made, easy account registration by utilizing the OCR feature and others. We believe that this application not only helps individuals, but also contributes to the growth of the entertainment industry in Indonesia as a whole. The app also aims to create new income opportunities for individuals with skills such as singer, illustrator, magician, comedian, model, presenter and other talents. The main aim of this app is to provide a centralized platform for talents to find jobs and earn money from their skills. This will be especially helpful for those who are just starting out in the industry and don't have access to a network of potential clients.
